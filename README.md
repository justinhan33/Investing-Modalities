# Shiny App: Savings & Investing Simulations
This project features a shiny app that allows the viewer to visualize—in an interactive way—different saving/investing scenarios up to a certain upper bound (ignoring inflation).

## Background
**Do you regularly save some money?**
* _**How much do you tend to save, and how often?**_ A dollar per day? A few dollars per
week? Maybe a few hundred dollars per year?
* _**For what purpose(s) do you save?**_ For traveling and vacations? For entertainment? For
your retirement? To buy a house?
* _**Where do you keep/invest (some of) your savings?**_ This is a tricky question
and the answer heavily depends on your savings goals.

The overarching aim of this project revolves around the following question:
**If you were to save some of your annual income for a number of years, how much
money could you expect to accumulate under different saving-investing cases
(ignoring inflation)?**

## Notes
1. **Initial Amount**: Money to be invested (range:[0,100000]).
2. **Annual Contribution**: Equivalent to annuity (range:[0,50000]).
3. **Return Rate (in %)**: Rate of return on investments (range:[0,20]).
4. **Growth Rate (in %)**: Rate at which you increase your annual contribution by (range:[0,20]).
5. **Years**: Amount of years for which the investment is planned for (range:[0,50]).
2. **Facet**: Choose between plotting each curve on separate graphs or on a single graph.
